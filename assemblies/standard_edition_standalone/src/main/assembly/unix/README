SSH

Vestige console is any SSH client.
You have to generate an rsa key pair (public / private).
Put the public key in ssh/authorized_keys and use the private key to connect to vestige console :
$ cat $HOME/.ssh/id_rsa.pub >> $VESTIGE_BASE/ssh/authorized_keys
$ ssh -i $HOME/.ssh/id_rsa -p 8422 admin@localhost
Do not distribute the private key and do not add unknown public key in ssh/authorized_keys because an access to vestige console allow to install any application on your computer (including virus).

Avoid a kill -9 which prevents vestige to shutdown properly.
